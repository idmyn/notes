## Why I don't use vim

I use vim emulation in emacs, because I think modal editing is a Good Idea. I
also think minimalism is great though, so I quite like the idea of using vim
(or, more likely, neovim) directly. Whenever I revisit vim I get annoyed by a
couple of things: not being able to resize text in split panes independently and
funky keybindings. I appreciate 'funky keybindings' is a bit vague, but an
example is not being able to set [emmet](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim)
expansion to a straightforward press of the tab key.
