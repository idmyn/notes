# Keyboards

I backed the [Keyboardio
Atreus](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus) on Kickstarter in
mid-March 2020 because I liked the idea of an ergo-split-ish keyboard compact
enough that I could bring it around with me if I wanted. Needless to say, the
pandemic struck so (at the time of writing) I've been working from home the
whole time, and the compact/unorthodox layout has been pretty frustrating
(particularly the placement of the apostrophe), so I'm thinking I might sell it
once the wrist rest arrives. I'm eyeing up the [Ultimate Hacking
Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/).
