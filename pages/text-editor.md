# Text editor

## Vim vs Emacs

I love the concept of modal editing from [[Vim]] (and [[Kakoune]]) but
I love [[Emacs]]' programmability and GUI. I revisited
[[Neovim]] around the time of its 0.5
release which included builtin LSP support, and I enjoyed configuring
it in [[Lua]], but I really missed emacs' gui: being able to resize
text in split windows independently.
