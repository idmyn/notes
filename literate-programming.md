# Literate Programming

Literate programming is a style of programming invented by Donald Knuth.
Basically, instead of the source code being at the forefront (with the
occasional explanatory comment), the code is written to be human-readable first
(and machine-readable second). Imagine one big markdown document with code
blocks, and those code blocks get assembled into source code files through a
build-step.
