# Thunderbird

There are a couple of things about
[Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-GB/) that appeal to me. It's
cross-platform, it handles plaintext email nicely, and it supports
"bottom-posting" (starting replies underneath the email you're replying to). 

At some point I'll write down a list of steps to get Thunderbird looking the way
I like. I'm still early in my
[userChrome.css](https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html)
journey!
