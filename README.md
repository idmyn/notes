# My Notes

I'm currently writing my notes in markdown files and publishing them on
[notes.davidmyno.rs](https://notes.davidmyno.rs) in the spirit of 'learning in public'.

My first encounter with this idea was [Nikita Voloboev's personal
wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/), and I've come across a few others since
then. [Gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/) is a particularly impressive example!
Although I initially planned on using 'wiki' in the url, I opted for 'notes' to
emphasise that the information is likely to be incomplete (and quite possibly
incorrect!) in many places. Who knows, maybe this will change in the future.

To understand the build process, you're welcome to have a look at [the
markdown](https://git.sr.ht/~idmyn/notes/tree), [the go program that produces
the website](https://git.sr.ht/~idmyn/zettelkasten), and [the build
manifest](https://git.sr.ht/~idmyn/zettelkasten/tree/refs/heads/main/.build.yml)
which triggers the website to build in [CI](https://builds.sr.ht/) when I
publish changes.
